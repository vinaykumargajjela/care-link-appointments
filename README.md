A modern, full-stack healthcare appointment booking application built with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Express. This project provides a seamless experience for users to find doctors, book appointments, and manage their healthcare journey.

#üöÄ Key Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.

Doctor Directory: Browse and search for healthcare professionals.

Real-time Booking: Book appointments with available time slots.

Professional UI: A clean, medical-themed design system built with shadcn/ui.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on all devices.

Search & Filter: Find doctors by specialization and availability.

#üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used
This project is built with a modern, full-stack technology set:

Frontend
React 18 & TypeScript: For building a robust and type-safe user interface.

Vite: As the frontend tooling for a fast development experience.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.

shadcn/ui: For a pre-built, accessible, and customizable component library.

React Router: To handle client-side routing.

TanStack Query (React Query): For managing server state, caching, and data fetching.

Lucide React: For a clean and consistent icon set.

Backend
Node.js & Express: To create the backend server and RESTful API.

CORS: To enable cross-origin requests from the frontend.

Nodemon: For automatic server restarts during development.

#üß† Challenges Faced & Solutions
During the development of this project, a few challenges were encountered:

Challenge: Creating a Realistic Mock Backend.

Solution: Instead of building a full database, an in-memory storage solution using JavaScript arrays was implemented in server.js. This allows for a functional backend that can handle GET and POST requests, mimicking a real database for demonstration purposes.

Challenge: Managing Asynchronous State.

Solution: TanStack Query (React Query) was used to handle server state, including data fetching, caching, and synchronization. This simplifies the process of managing asynchronous operations and provides a more robust solution than using useEffect and useState alone.

Challenge: Building a Professional and Consistent UI.

Solution: The project uses shadcn/ui, which provides a set of pre-built components that are accessible and easy to customize. This, combined with Tailwind CSS, allowed for the creation of a clean, medical-themed design system without having to build every component from scratch.

#üìà Improvements with More Time
Given more time, the following improvements could be made to the project:

Database Integration: Replace the in-memory storage with a proper database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.

Enhanced User Authentication: Implement a more secure authentication system with password hashing, JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), and protected routes on the backend.

Email Notifications: Integrate an email service to send appointment confirmations and reminders to users.

Payment Gateway: Add a payment gateway to handle appointment fees securely.

Admin Panel: Create a dedicated dashboard for doctors and administrators to manage appointments and schedules.

Unit and Integration Testing: Write tests for both the frontend and backend to ensure the application is reliable and bug-free.

#üöÄ Quick Start
